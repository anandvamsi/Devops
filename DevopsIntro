Take Dev and Anna as an example

Dev Team-
------------
Manages the code
Design few features
Testing team is also part of it

Team operations
-----------------
Manages the server
Scaling issues
security
backup


Problems:
1.Settings up the environments using conventional tools(shell scripts)
- Creating environments in non declarative method

2.Code in consistency 
3.Scaling issues.
4.Developes need to access the application logs :- Traditional shell scripts to pull the logs

Explain Devops log


what is the END goal :- we need to make push the releases and make customers Happy


Devops 
Integrate developers and operations teams
in order to improve collaboration and productivity 
by automating infrastructure ,automating workflows
and continuously  measuring applications
performance


Devops is philosophy  moving things from development stage to productions

> Automation
 -> code testing
 -> work flows
 -> Automate infrastructure 


Write softwares which is developted
tested and release and monitored  rather than
completing the code in one single shot and testing it

>They have a good consistancy of deploments in all the environments
>Good frequency of deployments

Source control 



END goal:- To provide customers environments without any issues
benefits

>- Time to market

Devops :- Equation
Change in Mindset + New tool :- Prepared for new fast paced world


Understanding Devops tool kit:-
A tool that sets the environment equally in N servers automatically (Software configuration tool);- Ansible,salt,Puppet
Every thing starts with a Automated code deployment:- which does code building ,testing and deploying :- Jenkins
All the codes are kept in repository which is called Git :- which will track all the code change and code management
A tool that manages the application,logs{system, application statitics} :- Monitoring

A infrastructure that holds all the Above Name as infrastructure as service Cloud
