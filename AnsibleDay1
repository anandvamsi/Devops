Configruration Managment system
--------------------------------
 systems engineering process for establishing and maintaining consistency of a product's performance, functional, and physical attributes with its requirements, design, and operational information throughout its life.

 By using automation, it's easier to build in checks and redundancies, improving the potential for omissions due to human error and the accuracy for keeping assets in the desired state

 Without automation, a single engineer forgetting to update a piece of software can leave a system with an outdated version of the software that has a known vulnerability listed on CVE. This vulnerability could be exploited to spread computer worms, install ransomware or another type of malware. 

 Configuration management applies to a variety of systems, but most often, you’ll be concerned with these:
Servers
Databases and other storage systems
Operating systems
Networking 
Applications
Software

Some of the Benefits of CMS
----------------------------
Reduced risk of outages and security breaches through visibility and tracking of the changes to your systems.
- Usecase Patching
Cost reduction by having detailed knowledge of all the elements of your configuration, avoiding wasteful duplication of your technology assets.
- Usecase:- No proper report of deployment report(Step by step)
Improved experience for your customers and internal staff  by rapidly detecting and correcting improper configurations that could negatively impact performance
- Usecase:- Mis configraion of settings.




Ansible and Architecture
--------------------------
Ansible is simple open source IT engine which automates application deployment,orchestration, cloud provisioning and many other IT tools.
Ansible is easy to deploy because it does not use any agents or custom security infrastructure


#Writing code in Ansible
Ansible uses playbook to describe automation jobs, and playbook uses very simple language i.e. YAML
It’s a human-readable data serialization language & is commonly used for configuration files, but could be used in many applications
Hence the advantage is that even the IT infrastructure support guys can read and understand the playbook and debug if needed

Ansible is completely agentless which means Ansible works by connecting your nodes through ssh(by default). But if you want other method for connection like Kerberos, Ansible gives that option to you.

After connecting to your nodes, Ansible pushes small programs called as “Ansible Modules”. Ansible runs that modules on your nodes and removes them when finished

Installation process
--------------------

There are two types of machines:
- Control machines
- Remote machine


Installation on control machines
------------------------------------
$ sudo apt-get update 
$ sudo apt-get install software-properties-common 
$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible $ sudo apt-get update 
$ sudo apt-get install ansible


Important files of Ansible
--------------------------
/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
/etc/ansible/roles/ 
/etc/ansible/hosts


checking the version after installation
~# ansible --version
ansible 2.9.16
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = [u'/home/anand/.ansible/plugins/modules', u'/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible
  executable location = /usr/bin/ansible
  python version = 2.7.6 (default, Jun 22 2015, 17:58:13) [GCC 4.8.2]
(base) root@ubuntu:~#


 ##Adding a sudo user in all the 3 servers
 useradd -m ansibleuser
 useradd -aG sudo ansibleuser
 passwd ansibleuser


#Create a keygen for ansibleuser in the master server and copy id.rsa.pub to salves ~ansibleuser/.ssh/authorizedkeys
