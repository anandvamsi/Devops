Configruration Managment system
--------------------------------
 systems engineering process for establishing and maintaining consistency of a product's performance, functional, and physical attributes with its requirements, design, and operational information throughout its life.

 By using automation, it's easier to build in checks and redundancies, improving the potential for omissions due to human error and the accuracy for keeping assets in the desired state

 Without automation, a single engineer forgetting to update a piece of software can leave a system with an outdated version of the software that has a known vulnerability listed on CVE. This vulnerability could be exploited to spread computer worms, install ransomware or another type of malware. 

 Configuration management applies to a variety of systems, but most often, youâ€™ll be concerned with these:
Servers
Databases and other storage systems
Operating systems
Networking 
Applications
Software
