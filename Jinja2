Jinja2 Templates
---------------------
 Jinja2 is a very popular and powerful Python-based template engine. Since Ansible is written in Python, it becomes the default choice for 
most users, just like other Python-based configuration management systems, such as Fabric and SaltStack

Some of the important features of Jinja2 are:
• It is fast and compiled just in time with the Python byte code
• It has an optional sandboxed environment
• It is easy to debug
• It supports template inheritance


{{ }} embeds variables inside a template and prints its value in the 
resulting file. This is the most common use of a template.
For example:
 {{ nginx_port }}

• {%    %} embeds statements of code inside a template, for example, for a loop, it embeds the if-else statements, 
which are evaluated at runtime but are not printed.
