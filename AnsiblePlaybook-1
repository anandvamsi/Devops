  - name: Run first playbook
    import_playbook: first-playbook.yml

we can replace import_playbook with include.

#Difference between import and include
The only difference is that the import statements are pre-processed at the time
playbooks are parsed. On the other hand, include statements are processed as they
are encountered during the execution of the playbook. So, in summary, import is
static while include is dynamic.
