#Ansible facts
Ansible facts are nothing but system properties or pieces of information about remote nodes that you have connected to. This information includes the System architecture, the OS version, BIOS information, system time and date, system uptime, IP address, and hardware information to mention just a few.

Ansible facts are handy in helping the system administrators which operations to carry out, for instance, depending on the operating system, they are able to know which software packages need to be installed, and how they are to be configured, etc


 ansible all  -m setup

 ansible all -m setup

Use case:
While deploying a NTP application/hosts file

<html>
<center>
   <h1> The hostname of this webserver is {{ ansible_hostname }}</h1>
   <h3> It is running on {{ ansible_os_family}}system </h3>
</center>
</html>


 Facts section data:
 ansible_architecture
ansible_bios_date
ansible_bios_version
ansible_date_time
ansible_machine
ansible_memefree_mb
ansible_os_family
ansible_selinux

##Creating custom facts
#mkdir -p /etc/ansible/facts.d
# vim /etc/ansible/facts.d/date_time.fact

#!/bin/bash
DATE=`date`
echo "{\"date\" : \"${DATE}\"}"

chmod +x /etc/ansible/facts.d/date_time.fact

ansible localhost -m setup | grep date
        "ansible_bios_date": "07/31/2013",
        "ansible_date_time": {
            "date": "2021-01-12",


YAML
 Ansible uses YAML because it is very easy for humans to understand, read and write when compared to other data formats like XML and JSON
 YAML uses simple key-value pair to represent the data.

 Example:- A student record:
--- #Optional YAML start syntax 
james: 
  name: james john 
  rollNo: 34 
  div: B 
  sex: male

## Representing a list
 ---
countries:  
   - America 
   - China 
   - Canada 
   - Iceland

## With dictonary 

james: 
   name: james john 
   rollNo: 34 
   div: B 
   sex: male 
   likes: 
      - maths 
      - physics 
      - english
