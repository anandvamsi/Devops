Devops Life cycle 
--------------------

Stage1:- 
     Plan :- JIRA 

stage2: 
     code::- Gitlab, Github

stage3:
    Build:: Ansible, puppet jenkins 

stage4: 
     Test:: selenium, 

Stage5:
     Deploy:: Jenkins, Docker,Kubernetes

Stage6:
      Operate:: Logging_solutions, splunl

stage: 
      Monitor:: Promethus, cloud monitoring tools


Devops in JobRoles:

Devops Engineer/Developer
Senior Devops Engineer
Devops Architect/specialist 
Devops Manager



In waterfall model
Its sequential model , where applications will move to next stage after completing current stage
stages in the waterfall model.

Need to understand the problems associated with WaterFall model.

Agile methadology
Practice of continious interations of Devops and testing happens.

- Each project is broken in multiple chunks


Limitations of Devops Engineer 
----------------------------------

Developers needs Agility
Operations needs stability of the applications 

Common problem:-
works in my laptop, but is it working in other {Dev,testing,production ..etc}. due to
inconsistancy during the building


Solutions 
In order to solve the Gap/ Limitations of the Agile, introduced a Devops software strategy

Public opinions
Devops is not technology its a methodology

Devops is a pratice, study of building,evolving and operating for rapidly changing systems at scale
reduces the gap b/w devlopers and operation team and able to release product in time.
How this happens:- By using automation and tools involved.




- All iterations should be part of same time duration (b/w 2 to 8 weeks)
- At the end of each iteration , a working product should be delivered::- demo time.
