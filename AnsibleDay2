Configuring inventories
Inventories var files


Ansible Inventory
Ansible works against multiple systems in your infrastructure at the same time.
 It does this by selecting portions of systems listed in Ansibleâ€™s inventory file, which defaults to being saved in the location /etc/ansible/hosts  can specify a different inventory file using the -i <path> option on the command line.


Example:-
mail.example.com

[webservers]
foo.example.com
bar.example.com

[dbservers]
one.example.com
two.example.com
three.example.com


Note:: Its ok to put more than one system in one or more groups.
for instance a server could be both a webserver and a dbserver


Security reason if ssh port is different we need to mention that along with hostname
one.example.com:678



Other examples of inventory
[webservers]
www[01:50].example.com


[databases]
db-[a:f].example.com

#Ansible host with connection variables
[targets]
localhost              ansible_connection=local
other1.example.com     ansible_connection=ssh        ansible_user=mpdehaan
other2.example.com     ansible_connection=ssh        ansible_user=mdehaa


Inventory with variables.
[atlanta]
host1 http_port=80 maxRequestsPerChild=808
host2 http_port=303 maxRequestsPerChild=909



Group of groups and variables
host1
host2

[raleigh]
host2
host3

[southeast:children]
atlanta
raleigh

[southeast:vars]
some_server=foo.southeast.example.com
halon_system_timeout=30
self_destruct_countdown=60
escape_pods=2




Other examples for iterations
------------------------------
[webservers]
cobweb
webbing
weber

webservers[0]       # == cobweb
webservers[-1]      # == weber
webservers[0:2]     # == webservers[0],webservers[1]
                    # == cobweb,webbing
webservers[1:]      # == webbing,weber
webservers[:3]      # == cobweb,webbing,we





#Setting up the invetory--> In Master server
/etc/ansible/hosts
[webserver]
slaves_IP



#Connectivity checking 
#Executions in the master server
~$ ansible all -m ping

    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}

Note: Above will login as the logged user and execute the module
-m is the module

#To begin individual server
ansible -m ping 192.168.150.129


#if you want to login to login to different user
ansible all -m ping -u <username>


#Using Ask password method
ansible all -m ping --ask-pass

    "ping": "pong"
}




#Shell module

##File based commands
##reating a directory
 ansible all -m file "dest = /tmp/newfolder  mode = 777 owner = user1 group = user1 state = directory" 
 ansible all -m file -a "dest=/tmp/test mode=755 owner=ansibleuser group=ansibleuser state=directory"

#copying a single file
 ansible all -m copy -a "src=/etc/hosts dest=/tmp/hosts

#To delete the directory
 ansible webservers -m file -a "dest=/path/to/c state=absent


#Package based <becoming root user>

Before this module make sure apt-get update
ansible --become -K all -m  apt -a "name=apache2 state=present"

#Install the latest version
ansible all -m apt -a "name=screen state=latest" --become -K

TO remove a package
ansible all -m apt -a "name=screen state=absent" --become -K


##Deployment
ansible all -m git -a "repo=https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms.git dest=/tmp/repo



#Services
 ansible webservers -m service -a "name=apache2 state=started" --become -K
 ansible webservers -m service -a "name=apache2 state=stopped" --become -K
 ansible webservers -m service -a "name=apache2 state=restarted" --become -K






#custom inventory file
ansible all -m ping -i my_custom_inventory

#shll
